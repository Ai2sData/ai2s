In the current digital world, web search engines and recommendation systems are continuously evolving, opening up new potential challenges every day which require more sophisticated and efficient data mining and machine learning solutions to satisfy the needs of sellers and consumers as well as marketers.  The quality of search and  recommendation systems impacts customer retention, time on site, and sales volume. For instance, with often sparse conversion rates, highly personalized contents, heterogeneous digital sources, more rigorous and effective models are required to be developed by research engineers and data scientists.  At the same time, deep learning has started to show great impact in many industrial applications which are capable of processing complicated, large-scale and real-time data.  Deep learning not only provides more opportunities to increase conversion rates and improve revenue through a positive customer experience, but also provides customers with personalized contents along with their personal shopping journey. Due to this rapid growth of the digital world, there is a need to bring professionals together from both academic research and the industry to solve real-world problems. This is exactly what this workshop aims to achieve. Topics of this workshop include deep learning based query understanding, personalization, representation learning, product retrieval, recommendation algorithm, ranking algorithms, etc.

			              Fundamental improvements in recommendation and ranking have been much harder to come by, when compared with recent progress on other long-standing AI problems such as visual/audio machine perception and machine translation. 
						Some reasons include: (1) large amounts of data making training difficult, yet having (2) noisy and sparse labels; (3) changing dynamics of context such as user preferences and items; and (4) low-latency requirement for a system response. Moreover, one new challenge is devising approaches to (5) learning more inclusive and robust models.

<br>
<br>
In this talk, Ed will touch upon many recent advances in neural modeling techniques for recommendations and their impact in Google products covering ~600 improvements over the last 5 years across these problems, including:

<ul>
  <li> (a). Multi-task models with gated mixture of experts and utilizing TPUs for large sparse models</li>
  <li> (b). Large output item spaces with Neural Deep Retrieval</li>
  <li> (c). Policy gradient RL techniques with off-policy correction in recommendation models</li>
	<li> (d). Diversification and slate optimization</li>
	<li> (e). Adversarial approaches for inclusiveness and robustness for Classifiers and Recommenders</li>
</ul>

					With the growing capabilities in how we represent and process structured and unstructured text, there are many opportunities to innovate newer and deeper search paradigms. This would allow us to go beyond building one-off models, each focusing on a specific question-answering (QA) task targeting a specific domain, reasoning skill, or answer type. In this talk, Caiming will start with a series of in-depth presentations on a few of the recent QA research conducted by the Salesforce AI Research team addressing several key questions in the QA domain.

We posit that the objective of recommendation of such complex information items shall go beyond high accuracy of satisfying user personal interests to high social responsibility.   Socially responsible recommender systems  call for shift to a new paradigm of data preparation, recommendation model and evaluation.

					Recent work in e-commerce product search and recommendations have shown result improvement by using large scale pre-trained model based Deep Learning approach. However, this has not been an easy task in the real-world development and deployment due to several constraints: 1) scaling the size of model and training data with computational efficiency is challenging; 2) boosting the incumbent ML applications performance using large scale pre-trained model in the real business setting requires careful algorithm design and data strategy; and 3) serving millions of requests per second at high throughput and low latency is a daunting task. In this talk, I will share our recent work that addresses these issues and a vision for future innovations.

					Platforms can provide users with a wide variety of options which may be both exciting and overwhelming. While a recommendation system provides users with relevant recommendations balanced with exploring new categories, they also need to be wary not only of irrelevant recommendations but also potentially inappropriate suggestions. Particularly where third party vendors or user-generated content is involved, it’s paramount that recommendation systems extract sufficient insights to provide a tailored positive user experience. In this talk, we’ll explore the challenges of defining this problem (eg. appropriate vs inappropriate), building robust models, as well as an iterative workflow to adapt to evolving language. The overall theory will be supplemented with real-world use cases where being proactive about these challenges not improved user experiences but led to new marketing opportunities.
